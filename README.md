# Fiord - FIO Report Data to Jenkins or InfluxDB

Fiord is a command-line tool that takes [FIO (Flexible I/O tester)](http://fio.readthedocs.io)
JSON output, reformats, then sends to metrics databases for retention and
analysis.

Supported Outputs:

- `summary`: Human-readable summary in table, raw, or a custom Go template format.
- `influxdb`: Sends report data to InfluxDB.
- `taurus`: Outputs in XML format that the Jenkins Performance Plugin can parse

## Usage

```text
$ ./fiord
Fiord summarizes FIO benchmark reports and can save them to a variety
of backend datastores.  It is intended to be used as part of a CI pipeline, and
includes a backend that produces output compatible with the Jenkins Performance
Plugin.  InfluxDB is also supported, and others may be added in the future.

Input should be in JSON format, generated by fio --output-format=json and piped
in using:
	fiords summary < input.json

Usage:
  fiord [command]

Available Commands:
  influxdb    Publish report to InfluxDB
  summary     Basic job summary
  taurus      Taurus final-status output

Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.fiord.yaml)
  -h, --help            help for fiord
  -t, --toggle          Help message for toggle

```
